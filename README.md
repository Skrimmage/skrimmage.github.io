# Skrimmage Website

This is the source for Skrimmage.com and the Skrimmage Blog. 

If you have any questions about the site, you may reach me at danny @ skrimmage dot com.

Tech Stack:
- Github Pages for hosting
- Hover for the domain
- Github automatically enables [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator, to build pages. Any posts in the `_posts` folder are then put online and the site index is rebuilt. 
- The Blog is hosted on [Digital Ocean](http://digitalocean.com) using the [Discourse Forum](https://www.discourse.org/) software.

Design:
- The main page is based off of Jekyll implementation of the [Creative Theme](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/creative/) template by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com).
- The blog is based off of the [Paper theme](https://github.com/mkchoi212/paper-jekyll-theme)
