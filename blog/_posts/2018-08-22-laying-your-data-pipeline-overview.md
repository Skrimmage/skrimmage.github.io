I recently gave a talk at the [2018 RIT Sports Analytics Conference](https://hockey-graphs.com/2018/08/13/2018-ritsac-slides-and-video/#more-22969). As a web developer, I want to show how you can push your data to the web in a way that's accessible to everyone. There's a lot of different ways to build a pipeline, so we'll start simple and then build in new tools. Keep an eye out for the blog posts next week!

Part 1: Using Datasette and Zeit to publish data quickly.
Part 2: Download results and turn it into a Glitch site.
Part 3: Use Github and Travis CI to download up-to-date data.
Part 4: Use Travis CI to auto-update your code and process the data for further analysis.

In the meantime, you can watch [my presentation](https://youtu.be/7nHoCBCdSlE?t=8462) on YouTube and view the slides. They contain links that will helpful for trying out some of these tools.
